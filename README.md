Class2Code is an innovative web-based platform that aims to bridge the gap between traditional academic learning and real-world job skills in software engineering.

It provides an immersive virtual environment that simulates the operations of a software company, allowing students to collaborate on realistic, long-term projects and gain hands-on experience across the entire software development lifecycle, with AI representing the client they will be working for.

I worked on the frontend part which was developed by react, Mantine UI, redux, Apollo client, bootstrap
I used Apollo client to read graph ql API

We have published a paper in the IEEE Scientific Papers titled Enhancing Software Engineering Education through an Authentic Web-Based Simulation of Corporate Workflows and it has been approved.
